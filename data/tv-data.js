Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn - from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. </p><p>Alternately challenged and supported by rival leader Bellamy, the two found common purpose: Survival. Through it all, Finn was helplessly drawn to Clarke, destroying his long-standing relationship with the brilliant young mechanic, Raven. Octavia got close to a possible enemy Grounder, Lincoln -- some say too close. Meanwhile, as <em>The 100</em> fought for their lives on the ground, The Ark's situation was no better. Though Abby believed that The 100 were still alive, she didn't have proof and couldn't stop Kane's population reduction. The killing of 320 volunteers and the subsequent realization that it was in error broke Kane and enflamed a revolution on the Ark that Chancellor Jaha, despite his best efforts, was powerless to stop. Both on the ground and in space, the final episodes will reveal the true desperation of their plight, as our heroes risked everything just to stay alive. </p><p>Noble sacrifices and heartbreaking choices changed everyone forever and left them scattered to the wind. The epic second chapter picks up with the newly returned human race desperate to be reunited. Season two's quest will challenge them beyond anything they have faced before. Hearts will be broken. Lives will be lost. Heroes will be born.</p>",

Joining McGarrett is Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams, a relocated ex-New Jersey cop - a working man in paradise who prefers skyscrapers to the coastline - but who's committed to keeping the Islands safe for his young daughter; Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-Honolulu police detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father who was wrongly accused of corruption; Dr. Max Bergman, the quirky coroner; Chin's cousin, Kono Kalakaua, a beautiful and fearless native; and Captain Lou Grover, who formerly headed Hawaii's SWAT unit. Joining them is Jerry Ortega, a former classmate of Chin's and the Island's local conspiracy theorist. The state's brash FIVE-0 unit, who may spar and jest among themselves, remain determined to eliminate the seedy elements from the 50th state.</p>",

An 8-year-old American boy wakes up alone in a rice paddy in a rural Chinese province with no idea how he got there. Details start to emerge when the boy, who calls himself Jacob, recalls that his hometown is Arcadia, and an Immigration agent, J. Martin Bellamy, takes him there. The home he claims as his own is occupied by a 60-year-old couple, Henry and Lucille Langston, who lost their son, Jacob, more than 30 years ago. While they look different, young Jacob recognizes them as his parents. Lucille is overjoyed at the seeming miracle of her son's reappearance. Henry is reluctant to accept that Jacob is back. Those closest to the family want answers, including Sheriff Fred Langston, whose wife Barbara drowned 30 years ago while trying to save Jacob, and Fred's daughter, Maggie, a local doctor. Pastor Tom Hale seeks a spiritual reason for what's happening in his community. When things take an even more shocking turn, Maggie's life-long friend, Elaine Richards, finds herself drawn into Arcadia's growing mystery. Bellamy, an outsider in the town, joins forces with Maggie to figure out why the unexplainable is happening in Arcadia. As their investigation plays out, Maggie learns some unsettling truths about her own past. Will they be able to solve the mystery of Arcadia before the rest of the world catches on to events there? And will they be able to protect Jacob from forces beyond their control?</p>",

            "summary": "<p><strong>Scorpion</strong>, inspired by a true story, is a high-octane drama about eccentric genius Walter O'Brien and his team of brilliant misfits who comprise the last line of defense against complex, high-tech threats of the modern age. As Homeland Security's new think tank, O'Brien's \"Scorpion\" team includes Toby Curtis an expert behaviorist who can read anyone; Happy Quinn, a mechanical prodigy; and Sylvester Dodd, a statistics guru. Pooling their extensive technological knowledge to solve mind-boggling predicaments amazes federal agent Cabe Gallo, who shares a harrowing history with O'Brien. However, while this socially awkward group is comfortable with each other's humor and quirks, life outside their circle confounds them, so they rely on Paige Dineen, who has a young, gifted son, to translate the world for them. At last, these nerdy masterminds have found the perfect job: a place where they can apply their exceptional brainpower to solve the nation's crises, while also helping each other learn how to fit in.</p>",

Barry is a passionate dreamer, who maybe dreams a little too big and who always gets the short end of the stick. Adam is the youngest, a camera-wielding future director who's navigating first love, and growing up with his family. Rounding out the family is beloved grandfather Al \"Pops\" Solomon, the wild man of the clan, a shameless Don Juan who's learning as much from his family as he teaches them.</p>",

By his side is his young, vivacious second wife Gloria, who resists his old-fashioned ways -- an impulse that will become all the more interesting now that he and Gloria have a new baby of their own. This exciting addition will bring more adventures to the family just as Gloria's son, Manny, is about to embark on an adventure of his own as he enters high school. Jay's grown daughter, Claire, and her husband, Phil, also have their son, Luke, heading to high school; their middle daughter, Alex, is full steam ahead on the college track, and the eldest, Haley, is back home figuring out her future. With the kids all growing up, this new chapter means Claire can explore returning to the workforce, which will have its fair share of missteps and victories. And this will be a big year for Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell, who alongside his loving partner, Cameron, and daughter Lily, will have a lot of reasons to celebrate. Together these three families give us an honest and often hilarious look into the sometimes warm, sometimes twisted, embrace of the modern family.</p>",

Arriving in France with four close friends as her ladies-in-waiting, Mary has been sent to secure Scotland's strategic alliance by formalizing her arranged engagement to the French king's dashing son, Prince Francis. But the match isn't signed and sealed, it depends more on politics, religion and secret agendas than affairs of the heart. With danger and sexual intrigue around every dark castle corner, Mary rallies her ladies-in-waiting and steels herself, ready to rule the new land and balance the demands of her country and her heart.</p>",

Frank Reagan is the New York Police Commissioner and heads both the police force and the Reagan brood. He runs his department as diplomatically as he runs his family, even when dealing with the politics that plagued his unapologetically bold father, Henry, during his stint as Chief. A source of pride and concern for Frank is his eldest son Danny, a seasoned detective, family man and Iraq War vet who on occasion uses dubious tactics to solve cases with his loyal and tough partner, Detective Jackie Curatola. The Reagan women in the family include Erin, a N.Y. Assistant D.A., who also serves as the legal compass for her siblings and father, and single parent to her teenage daughter Nicky; and Linda, Danny's supportive wife. Jamie is the youngest Reagan, a recent grad of Harvard Law and the family's \"golden boy.\" Unable to deny the family tradition, Jamie has decided to give up a lucrative future in law and follow in the family footsteps as a cop.</p>",

With a rush comes the horrible awareness that the plane he was on tore apart in mid-air and crashed on a Pacific island. From there it's a blur, as his doctor's instinct kicks in: people need his help.</p><p>Stripped of everything, the 48 survivors scavenge what they can from the plane for their survival. Some panic. Some pin their hopes on rescue. A few find inner strength they never knew they had -- like Kate, who, with no medical training, suddenly finds herself suturing the doctor's wounds. Hurley - a man with a warm sense of humor despite the desperate situation - does his best to keep his cool as he helps those around him to survive. Charlie is a faded rock star who harbors a painful secret. Sayid is a Middle Eastern man who must wrestle with the racial profiling directed at him by some of his fellow survivors. Jin and Sun are a Korean couple whose traditions, values and language are foreign, and thus causes much to get lost in the translation. Sawyer has an air of danger surrounding him, and his intense sense of mistrust for everyone around him could prove to be fatal to his fellow castaways. Michael has just gained custody of his nine-year-old son, Walt, after the death of his ex-wife - they are a father and son who don't even know each other. Locke is a mysterious man who keeps to himself, and who harbors a deeper connection to the island than any of the others. Self-centered Shannon - who actually gives herself a pedicure amid the chaos - and her estranged controlling brother, Boone , constantly bicker and must learn to get along if they are to survive. And young Claire is eight months pregnant and ill-prepared for the hardships of motherhood - especially on a deserted island.</p>",

Now age 23, Jane is a driven young woman studying to become a teacher, nursing a dream to be a writer, and supporting herself with a job at a hot new Miami hotel. All the years of watching telenovelas with the two women who raised her - her sexy, young-at-heart mother, Xiomara, and her still-devout grandmother, Alba - have given Jane a slightly unrealistic view of romance. Still, she is determined not to make the same mistake her mother made - becoming an unwed mother at 16. Jane has managed to find a wonderful fiancé: a handsome, hard-working detective named Michael, who loves her enough to accept her detailed timeline for their future together and even her insistence on \"saving herself\" until they're married. All of Jane's meticulous life plans are turned upside down, however, when she sees her doctor for a routine check-up and is accidentally artificially inseminated with a specimen meant for the patient in the next room. Unbeknownst to her, the specimen belongs to Rafael, a reformed playboy and cancer survivor, who is not only the new owner of the hotel where Jane works but also a former summer crush of hers. A few weeks later, the unsuspecting Jane is faced with the most important decisions of her life. Will she continue with the pregnancy? How can she explain the situation to her fiancé and family? And what should she do about the wishes of the biological father, Rafael, and his scheming wife Petra? Though she has always tried to be the good girl who does the right thing, Jane's life has suddenly become as dramatic and complicated as the telenovelas she has always loved.</p>",

Also important to the ‘Looking' mix is the progressive, unpredictable, sexually open culture of the Bay Area, with real San Francisco locations serving as a backdrop for the group's lives. Rounding out the ‘Looking' world are a bevy of dynamic gay men including Kevin, Lynn, and Richie, as well as a wide-range of supporting characters like Dom's roommate Doris, Agustín's boyfriend Frank, and Patrick's co-worker Owen.</p>",

This list of the most vital security issues facing the nation brings with it moral and political judgment calls for Charleston and... her trusted group of brilliant analysts at the agency. Aside from the political minefields she has to walk, Charlie has a close personal relationship with the President because she was once engaged to her son before a tragic terrorist attack took his life. Charlie survived that attack and is now determined to bring the perpetrators to justice. Navigating a complex personal life and a pressure-cooker profession is, of course, a challenge, and Charlie sometimes engages in boundary-pushing behavior to avoid facing her grief. But when the clock strikes 2 a.m., she is all about her job — protecting her nation, serving her President and still trying to get to the bottom of her fiancé's murder that will reveal itself as a shocking mystery.</p>",

Only the Battlestar Galactica (an old warship about to be decommissioned and turned into a museum) and those souls fortunate enough to be aboard other starships were able to survive the attack. In the aftermath, the Galactica's commanding officer, William Adama, finds himself responsible for safeguarding the last remnants of the human race—fewer than 50,000 desperate survivors. Meanwhile, the annihilation of the Colonial government results in the succession of the Secretary of Education, Laura Roslin, to the presidency.

In Seasons Two and Three, as the Barksdale investigation escalated, new storylines involving pressures on the working class and the city's political leadership were introduced. Season Four focused on the stories of several young boys in the public school system, struggling with problems at home and the lure of the corner - set against the rise of a new drug empire in West Baltimore and a new Mayor in City Hall. The fifth and final season of <em>The Wire</em> centers on the media's role in addressing - or failing to address - the fundamental political, economic and social realities depicted over the course of the series, while also resolving storylines of the numerous characters woven throughout the narrative arc of the show.</p>",

            "summary": "<p>When Emery was 6 years old, an alien spacecraft crash-landed in her small town. Whether they came in peace or with more sinister intentions didn't matter: a fierce battle erupted as humans fought for control over their new rivals, an alien species called the Atrians. In the midst of the conflict, Roman, a 6-year-old Atrian boy, found his way to a shed behind Emery's house, where she protected him from harm, bringing him food, comfort - and friendship. In their brief time together, Emery and Roman forged a deep bond, but the authorities wasted no time tracking Roman down and capturing him in a violent confrontation. Emery has grown up believing that Roman was killed that day. Ten years later, the Atrians have been acclimated to life on Earth, but they are interned in a heavily-guarded camp known as the Sector to keep them separate from humans. Now, for the first time, a group of Atrian teens will enroll in a suburban human high school, with the goal of testing the feasibility of human/alien integration. The eyes of the nation and the whole world are fixed on this historical social experiment, an endeavor fraught with suspicion and fear. In the mayhem of the first day, Emery is amazed to learn that Roman was not killed by the authorities and is, in fact, one of the Atrian students. Their childhood bond is quickly rekindled - in a school and a society that distrusts everything about the Atrians, Emery and Roman have found each other again. However, their relationship is threatened by the small-mindedness of their respective communities and the political agendas of people in power. While the world around them rages with anger and prejudice, their bond becomes increasingly strong and increasingly dangerous. As an epic Romeo and Juliet romance unfolds, a violent encounter between Roman's father and Emery's father occurs in the Sector. Can Roman and Emery's love - and peace between the species - survive?</p>",

Stephen Jameson stands at the crossroads between the world we know and the shifting world of the future. Up until a year ago, Stephen was a \"normal\" teenager - until he began hearing voices and teleporting in his sleep, never knowing where he might wake up. Now, Stephen's issues have gone far beyond the usual teenage angst, and he is beginning to question his sanity. In desperation, Stephen decides to listen to one of the voices in his head, and it leads him to his first encounter with the Tomorrow People - John, Cara and Russell - a genetically advanced race with the abilities of telekinesis, teleportation and telepathic communication. The Tomorrow People are being hunted down by a paramilitary group of scientists known as Ultra. Led by Dr. Jedikiah Price, Ultra sees the Tomorrow People as a very real existential threat from a rival species, and the outcast group has been forced to hide out in an abandoned subway station just beneath the surface of the human world. Trading in secrets, Jedikiah offers Stephen the chance for a normal life with his family and best friend, Astrid, if he will help in the struggle to isolate and eradicate the Tomorrow People. On the other hand, Cara, John and Russell offer Stephen a different type of family and a home where he truly belongs. Unwilling to turn his back on humanity or the world of the Tomorrow People, Stephen sets out on his own path - a journey that could take him into the shadowy past to uncover the truth about his father's mysterious disappearance, or into an unknown future with The Tomorrow People.</p>",

            "summary": "<p><strong>Almost Human</strong> is an action-packed police drama set 35 years in the future, when police officers are partnered with highly evolved human-like androids. The year is 2048. Meet John Kennex a cop who survived one of the most catastrophic attacks ever made against the police department. After waking up from a 17-month coma, he can't remember much - except that his partner was killed; his girlfriend, Anna Moore, left him after the attack; and he lost one of his legs and is now outfitted with a highly sophisticated synthetic appendage. Suffering from depression, mental atrophy, trauma-onset OCD, PTSD and the \"psychological rejection of his synthetic body part,\" John returns to work at the behest of longtime ally Captain Sandra Maldonado. By mandate, every cop must partner with a robot. And despite his passionate aversion to androids, John is paired up with a battle-ready MX-43. But he abruptly terminates his partnership after the robot discovers incriminating information about him. So technician Rudy Lom introduces John to Dorian, a discontinued android with unexpected emotional responses. Although such responses were deemed flaws, it is in these \"flaws\" that John relates to Dorian most. After all, John is part-machine now, and Dorian is part-human. John and Dorian's understanding of each other not only complements them, it connects them. As he adjusts to working with his new partner, John also must learn to get along with his new colleagues, including the eager and somewhat starstruck Detective Valerie Stahl and the distrustful Detective Richard Paul, who does not welcome John back with open arms. Almost Human will follow the week-to-week missions of John and Dorian, as they fight crime across this futuristic landscape, while the mysteries surrounding his attack and the larger mythology of this new world unfold.</p>",

Simon Roberts is the head of a powerful agency, with the biggest clients and brands in the world, but even more important to him is that his daughter Sydney is by his side. As his partner, Sydney is Simon's exact opposite - focused, organized and eager to make a name for herself, but also too busy parenting her father, which she'd resent if he wasn't so brilliant at what he does. Joining them in the firm are the dashing and talented Zach art director Andrew, who's as hard-working as he is neurotic; and the beautiful and deceptively smart assistant Lauren. With his team and his daughter behind him, Simon continues to set the advertising world on fire, and it looks like they are definitely buying what these crazy ones are selling.</p>",

            "summary": "<p>The epic battle between a determined police chief and a dangerous mobster inflames 1940s Los Angeles in TNT's eagerly anticipated television event Mob City. This powerful drama comes to TNT from Frank Darabont, who wrote and directed the pilot and serves as executive producer on the series. Based on the critically acclaimed book L.A. Noir: The Struggle for the Soul of America's Most Seductive City, by John Buntin, Mob City opens in post-war Los Angeles, home to glamorous movie stars, powerful studio heads and returning war heroes. But it's also a city caught between a powerful and corrupt police force and an even more dangerous criminal network determined to make L.A. its West Coast base. Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker has made it his mission to free the city of criminals like Ben \"Bugsy\" Siegel and Mickey Cohen, the ruthless king of the Los Angeles underworld. Parker also won't hesitate to go after anyone from his own police force who sells out honor and duty for the sake of a big payout. To carry out his sweep of organized crime, Parker sets up a new mob task force within the LAPD. Headed by Det. Hal Morrison, the task force includes Det. Joe Teague, an ex-Marine who holds his cards close to his chest.</p>",

Over a radio channel, designed only to be used if their homeland has been wiped out, they're told to fire nuclear weapons at Pakistan. Captain Marcus Chaplin demands confirmation of the orders only to be unceremoniously relieved of duty by the White House. XO Sam Kendal finds himself suddenly in charge of the submarine and facing the same difficult decision. When he also refuses to fire without confirmation of the orders, the Colorado is targeted, fired upon, and hit. The submarine and its crew find themselves crippled on the ocean floor, declared rogue enemies of their own country. Now, with nowhere left to turn, Chaplin and Kendal take the sub on the run and bring the men and women of the Colorado to an exotic island.

Ralph Lamb wants to be left in peace to run his ranch, but Las Vegas is now swelling with outsiders and corruption which are intruding on his simple life. Recalling Lamb's command as a military police officer during World War II, the Mayor appeals to his sense of duty to look into a murder of a casino worker - and so begins Lamb's clash with Vincent Savino, a ruthless Chicago gangster who plans to make Vegas his own. Assisting Lamb in keeping law and order are his two deputies: his diplomatic, even-keeled brother Jack and his charming but impulsive son Dixon. Ambitious Assistant District Attorney Katherine O'Connell, who grew up on the ranch next to the Lambs, also lends a hand in preserving justice. In Vegas, two powerful men - Lamb and Savino - are engaged in a fierce battle for control of the budding oasis, and for both of them, folding is not an option. </p>",

By his side stands his beautiful wife Lucretia who will help her husband achieve his ambitions, whatever the cost. Batiatus puts all his fortunes on the man who will gain him fame and glory.

Former champion, Oenomaus, reluctantly becomes Doctore, while Syrian recruits Ashur and Dagan try to prove themselves worthy of being gladiators.

Against all of this, the city's splendid new arena nears completion and with it the opening games that will make slaves into gods. When the arena opens, Batiatus' gladiators prevail in the contest.

For millennia, Shao Kahn—the Emperor of Outworld—has successfully expanded his domain by defeating other realms. Edenia was the last realm to lose the tournament and fall to Shao Kahn. Ten years ago in the last tournament, Outworld and Earth-realm's warriors clashed, and Liu Kang emerged victorious. Earth-realm was spared. But now Shao Kahn's challenge has come again, and a new war is about to commence. The fate of Earth-realm and its inhabitants rests upon the outcome of this tournament.

As a child, her father nicknamed her Painkiller Jane, describing her ability to mentally push through even the most painful situations. But her strength is about to be tested. Jane is recruited by a covert government agency dedicated to containing and, if necessary, neutralizing the threat of \"Neuros\" — individuals with superhuman neurological powers. No one knows what caused the aberrations that led to their enhanced abilities, which range from from telekinesis and telepathic suggestion to induced hallucinations. During her first investigation with her new team, Jane discovers that she too possesses an odd ability: she can't be killed. Unfortunately, she can still feel pain. Her newfound powers make Jane even more determined to learn everything there is to know about Neuros. Seldom malicious, Neuros often can't control their powers. Consequently, they tend to leave a trail of death and destruction. To prevent a panic, the government has kept the discovery of Neuros a secret, assembling a covert unit to identify and contain Neuros. Operating from a secure abandoned subway platform, the core members of the unit are Andre McBride, the seasoned team leader; Connor King, a special agent regularly armed with a smart remark; Riley Jensen, an evolved computer whiz in charge of surveillance and communications; Dr. Seth Carpenter, the unit's doctor and scientist; Joe Waterman, the middle-aged caretaker of the subway; and Maureen Bowers, Jane's former DEA partner and friend, who, like Jane, was recruited after discovering top-secret information about Neuros.

But after the tragic (and still unsolved) murder of his wife Trudy, Monk developed an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Now consumed by peculiar obsessions and wracked with hundreds of phobias (including but certainly not limited to germs, heights, and even milk), Monk has lost his badge and struggles with even the simplest everyday tasks. Despite his many quirks, Monk is fortunate to have some supportive friends. With the help of his gifted therapist Dr. Kroger, Monk has made some gradual progress in controlling his condition. Monk's first personal assistant, Sharona Fleming, was able to help him pick up the pieces of his life and get back to doing what he does best: solving crimes. Though Monk was devastated when she moved away, he soon found hope in the form of a spunky new assistant, Natalie Teeger, whose unique brand of tough love proved to be just what Monk needed. In Natalie, Monk has found more than just an assistant; she's a faithful friend, a savvy businesswoman, and, it turns out, a pretty good assistant detective to boot. Natalie and her teenage daughter Julie have welcomed Monk into their family. And though Natalie and Monk have grown close, she's never afraid to give her boss a loving kick in the pants when he needs it. Now working as a private consultant, Monk continues to investigate cases in the most unconventional ways. Although Monk is no longer a member of the police force, his former boss Captain Leland Stottlemeyer still often calls upon him to provide unique insights into cases that have the cops stumped. Stottlemeyer himself is a highly decorated detective, but he knows he will never be as good as the illustrious Monk... and it drives him crazy. Still, he's a loyal friend to Monk, as is Lieutenant Randall Disher the Captain's self-appointed go-to guy, a cop with enough eagerness to almost make up for his lack of brilliance as a detective. Monk is a detective afraid of the dark, a gumshoe afraid of gum. He has no problem cracking a case - as long as it doesn't involve heights or germs, and is in close proximity to his apartment. Other than solving his wife's murder, Monk would like nothing more than to gain back his position on the San Francisco police force, but can he pull himself together and get back to solving crimes full time?</p>", "updated": 1478582400, "_links": { "self": { "href": "http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/543" }, "previousepisode": { "href": "http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/49977" } } }, { "id": 544, "url": "http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/544/home-improvement", "name": "Home Improvement", "type": "Scripted", "language": "English", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family"], "status": "Ended", "runtime": 30, "premiered": "1991-09-17", "schedule": { "time": "20:00", "days": ["Friday"] }, "rating": { "average": 8 }, "weight": 0, "network": { "id": 3, "name": "ABC", "country": { "name": "United States", "code": "US", "timezone": "America/New_York" } }, "webChannel": null, "externals": { "tvrage": 3887, "thetvdb": 77537, "imdb": "tt0101120" }, "image": { "medium": "http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/4/11457.jpg", "original": "http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/4/11457.jpg" }, "summary": "<p><strong>Home Improvement</strong> was about Tim \"The Toolman\"\nTaylor, host of the home-improvement show \"Tool Time,\" definitely is\nnot as handy at home as he is on screen.

Like Mike, they are all professionally capable but personally challenged.</p>", "updated": 1480293027, "_links": { "self": { "href": "http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/656" }, "previousepisode": { "href": "http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/57949" } } }, { "id": 657, "url": "http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/657/spooks", "name": "Spooks", "type": "Scripted", "language": "English", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller", "Espionage"], "status": "Ended", "runtime": 60, "premiered": "2002-05-13", "schedule": { "time": "21:00", "days": ["Monday"] }, "rating": { "average": 9 }, "weight": 0, "network": { "id": 12, "name": "BBC One", "country": { "name": "United Kingdom", "code": "GB", "timezone": "Europe/London" } }, "webChannel": null, "externals": { "tvrage": 4458, "thetvdb": 78890, "imdb": "tt0160904" }, "image": { "medium": "http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/5/13652.jpg", "original": "http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/5/13652.jpg" }, "summary": "<p>Tense drama series about the different challenges faced by the British Security Service as they work against the clock to safeguard the nation.</p>", "updated": 1462309529, "_links": { "self": { "href": "http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/657" }, "previousepisode": { "href": "http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/58035" } } }, { "id": 658, "url": "http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/658/crossbones", "name": "Crossbones", "type": "Scripted", "language": "English", "genres": ["Drama", "Action", "Adventure"], "status": "Ended", "runtime": 60, "premiered": "2014-05-30", "schedule": { "time": "22:00", "days": ["Friday"] }, "rating": { "average": 6.9 }, "weight": 0, "network": { "id": 1, "name": "NBC", "country": { "name": "United States", "code": "US", "timezone": "America/New_York" } }, "webChannel": null, "externals": { "tvrage": 31716, "thetvdb": 259030, "imdb": "tt2400631" }, "image": { "medium": "http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/5/13668.jpg", "original": "http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/5/13668.jpg" }, "summary": "<p>It's 1715 on the Bahamian island of Santa Campana, the first functioning democracy in the Americas, where the diabolical pirate Edward Teach, a.k.a.

To gain control of this fearsome society, Tom Lowe, a highly skilled undercover assassin, is sent to the buccaneers' haven to take down the brilliant and charismatic Blackbeard. But the closer Lowe gets, the more he finds that his quest is not so simple. Lowe can't help but admire the political ideals of Blackbeard, whose thirst for knowledge knows no bounds - and no law.

Two wives discover that it often isn't when they hand over the keys to their homes and literally switch families — but not bedrooms — for two weeks on the new reality show Wife Swap, already a critically-acclaimed smash hit in its third season in the U.K.<br /><br />Wife Swap is not a competition or a contest. It is a reality show unlike any other, where the battlegrounds are the kitchens and living rooms, child-rearing is a subject of intense and heated debate, and the outcome isn't a cash prize, but a couple's opportunity to re-discover why they love each other and decided to marry in the first place.<br /><br />In the first week of the swap, the wives move in with their new family and adopt their very different lifestyle. They agree to follow a manual written by the departing wife that sets out the rules of their new household – how they parent, shop, do the house work, manage their budgets and their social life. But then, in the second week, everything changes. The new wives take charge. They introduce their own set of rules and get to run the new household their way. It's a radical shock to both families. The results are explosive, enlightening and often very funny. This is a show about the things that really matter to families across America.<br /><br />At the end of the show, the two couples meet for the first time. In a highly-charged exchange of views, both couples make a frank assessment of each other and talk about what they've learned from the experience.</p>","updated":1442742349,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/819"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/73667"}}},{"id":820,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/820/hung","name":"Hung","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Comedy"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"2009-06-28","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":7.4},"weight":0,"network":{"id":8,"name":"HBO","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":21942,"thetvdb":82091,"imdb":"tt1229413"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/43/109608.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/43/109608.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Ray Drecker is a middle-aged basketball coach and high school history teacher who figures out how to put his exceptional physical endowments to use and change his fortunes.

With the help of his Grandpa Max and \"dweeb\" cousin Gwen, Ben defeats his arch-nemesis Vilgax in the \"Secret of the Omnitrix\" movie special, leaving the planet earth safe from evil alien threats. In \"Ben 10: Alien Force\" (premiered April 2008), our hero is now fifteen years old and must once again use the Omnitrix to protect the earth from a new, sinister alien conspiracy that threatens to conquer the entire universe! This time around he has the help of not only his cousin Gwen (who is learning to master alien powers of her own), but his old nemesis Kevin Levin. Together, our trio of heroes span the globe (and galaxy!) to protect the earth from threats as they arise. Picking up immediately where \"Ben 10: Alien Force\" leaves off, \"Ben 10: Ultimate Alien\" (premiering April 2010) follows the now 16-year-old Ben as his life changes in major ways! The Omnitrix has been destroyed and Ben must now learn to master the secrets of the mysterious Ultimatrix, a new watch-like device that not only allows him to transform into a variety of alien super heroes, but also gives him the ability to activate evolved (or \"ultimate\") versions of some of his most powerful alien entities!

As she advances her acting, modeling and business career, she is juggling a prominent role in her large, tight-knit family. With her tell-it-like-it-is mom, Lynn, and chilled-out dad, Mark, at the center of this crazy bunch, Audrina is still expected to have an active presence in the lives of her three younger siblings: former wild child Casey, now married to motocross star Kyle Loza and mother of two; genial younger brother Marky, who aspires to pro motocross himself and has an annoying habit of befriending Audrina's exes; and 15-year-old sister Samantha, who is already exhibiting a rebellious streak that could put Casey and Audrina's to shame. Work-focused and family-oriented, yet still sexy and dynamic, Audrina shows a personal side of herself on VH1 that is funny, relatable and endearing to anyone who's ever had to balance the expectations of family and friends against their own hopes and dreams.

He claims that he has been sent to New York City by Zeus to bring 100 romantically challenged couples together before being allowed to return to Mt. Olympus. His persistence eventually lands him in a mental institution. Three months later, Trevor is found to be harmless to himself and others and is released -- but under certain conditions. Placed under the care of psychiatrist and self-help author Dr. Claire McCrae, he must attend her singles group therapy sessions on a regular basis so that she can monitor his progress. Trevor returns to his rented room upstairs from the struggling Tres Equis Cantina, owned by Felix Araiza and his sister, Lita. In exchange for rent, Trevor becomes a bartender and creates an atmosphere for singles looking for lasting love. His ideas, such as half-price margarita nights and mariachi karaoke duets, could help him bring couples together and ultimately take him closer to the day that he gets to return to Mt. Olympus. No one believes Trevor's story, but everyone finds him to be quite charming. Although he possesses a great knowledge of Greek mythology, Claire finds that Trevor constantly interferes and contradicts her when it comes to her pragmatic style of helping lonely hearts find their soul mates. In true love, Claire believes it's all about friendship and mutual respect; for Trevor, heat and passion conquer all. Only time will tell who will win this battle for love.</p>","updated":1479229798,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1091"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/102574"}}},{"id":1092,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1092/death-comes-to-pemberley","name":"Death Comes to Pemberley","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2013-12-26","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":[]},"rating":{"average":8.2},"weight":0,"network":{"id":12,"name":"BBC One","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","timezone":"Europe/London"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":38490,"thetvdb":270814,"imdb":"tt2951788"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/6/17213.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/6/17213.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Adaptation of PD James's bestselling homage to Pride and Prejudice.

But for one Chicago doctor, who is indebted to the mafia, saving lives isn't her only concern. THE MOB DOCTOR is a fast-paced medical drama featuring a brilliant young female cardiothoracic surgeon who is split between two distinct worlds as she juggles her promising medical career with her lifelong debt as a doctor to Chicago's Southside mob. DR. GRACE DEVLIN is a top resident at Chicago's Roosevelt Medical Center. Smart and self-assured, she's heralded as one of the country's most promising young surgeons. But family ties keep her glued to her Southside roots. To pay off her brother's life-threatening gambling debt, she makes a deal with the devil and agrees to work \"off book\" for the mafia men she once despised. During the day, Grace must deal with the emotionally compelling cases at Roosevelt Medical - a toddler in need of a heart transplant, an elderly man desperate to donate a lung to his sick wife, the mass chaos in the wake of a two-train collision on the 'L.' But in her other vastly different world, she must juggle an onslaught of mob-related demands, including operating in mob-sanctioned locations, removing bullets from dead bodies to hide incriminating evidence, saving a juiced-up race horse and covertly helping an aging mobster with his erectile dysfunction. All the while, Grace must keep her dual life a secret from everyone: her protective best friend, NURSE ROBERTA \"RO\" ANGELI; her handsome, blue-blooded boyfriend, DR. BRETT ROBINSON; her boss at Roosevelt Medical and Chief of Surgery, DR. STAFFORD WHITE; her rival, DR. OLIVIA WATSON even her well-meaning screw-up brother, NATE, and her overly dramatic mother, DANIELLA. The only one who knows the true scope of Grace's activities is the man to whom Grace owes her debt: the charming and diabolical Southside mob boss CONSTANTINE ALEXANDER, an oddly compassionate killer whose relationship with Grace is more than it seems. Recently released from prison, the former head of the Chicago mob looks to reclaim his place in the organization, with the help of his right-hand associate - and Grace's ex-boyfriend - FRANCO. As Grace tries to heed the demands of these two conflicting worlds - not to mention the needs of her own slightly dysfunctional family - her moral center comes into direct conflict with the very immoral things she's asked to do. But with nerves of steel and a tough-as-nails exterior, she somehow manages to make it all work - at least for now.</p>","updated":1470997512,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1234"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/108354"}}},{"id":1235,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1235/low-winter-sun","name":"Low Winter Sun","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2013-08-11","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Sunday"]},"rating":{"average":7.1},"weight":0,"network":{"id":20,"name":"AMC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":31590,"thetvdb":267206,"imdb":"tt2314792"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/7/17727.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/7/17727.jpg"},"summary":"<p>\"Low Winter Sun\" is a contemporary story of murder, deception, revenge and corruption in a world where the line between cops and criminals is blurred.

Sydney Andrews is the landlady, still beautiful at 40, and a central figure in the lives of all her tenants, especially handsome and rebellious David Breck. Sydney started an affair with David despite her turbulent history with his estranged father, Dr. Michael Mancini. Both father and son learned through experience that Sydney was not above using blackmail to control people. Another tenant, high-powered publicist Ella Simms, once considered Sydney her mentor, but their friendship was destroyed by betrayal, and Sydney threatened to evict Ella and ruin her career. Sydney also played a pivotal role in the career of Auggie Kirkpatrick. After they met at an AA meeting, she became Auggie's sponsor and encouraged his dream to become a chef. Now a successful sous chef at the trendy restaurant Coal, Auggie has been avoiding Sydney since she began drinking again. The other tenants include Lauren Yung, a medical student in desperate need of money to pay her student loans, and Jonah Miller, an aspiring filmmaker who has just proposed to his live-in girlfriend Riley Richmond, a first-grade teacher. The newest tenant, 18-year-old Violet Foster, has just arrived in LA with her own secret connection to Sydney. When a bloody body is found floating in the courtyard pool, David is the leading suspect. However, as the police are soon to discover, almost everyone living at <strong>Melrose Place</strong> had a reason to want the deceased out of the way.</p>","updated":1479782460,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1260"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/109512"}}},{"id":1262,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1262/law-order-uk","name":"Law & Order: UK","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Crime"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2009-02-23","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":[]},"rating":{"average":8.8},"weight":0,"network":{"id":35,"name":"ITV","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","timezone":"Europe/London"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":18198,"thetvdb":85228,"imdb":"tt1166893"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/7/18188.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/7/18188.jpg"},"summary":"<p>In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important groups: the police who investigate crime, and the Crown Prosecutors who prosecute the offenders.

But just as things are looking like they can't get worse, a stranger named John arrives – and the Yosts' banal existence is lifted into something profound, miraculous and, possibly, universal. Set in Imperial Beach, California, the last great surf-break before Tijuana, where the U.S. meets Mexico, and water meets land, John From Cincinnati tells the story of the Yosts, a family of surfers whose awesome athletic talents have seemed for generations to come with a curse attached.

In shaping Shaun's career, his grandmother Cissy strives to achieve a commercial and athletic success that will compensate for the frustrations and failures of her life with her husband and son. Into this world, where even simple joy has been turned into a commodity, steps a mysterious stranger named John.

The series saw six seasons and one-hundred-four half-hour episodes. Sponsored by cereal manufacturer Kellogg's, the show's initial and final air dates are sometimes disputed but generally accepted as September 19, 1952 to April 28, 1958. The show's first two seasons were filmed in black-and-white while seasons four through six were filmed in color, though broadcast monochromatically. </p><p>Adventures of Superman was the first television series to feature Superman though the superhero had appeared as a character in a radio program starring Bud Collyer, two theatrical serials starring Kirk Alyn and Noel Neill, and a series of Max Fleischer cartoons. The television series began filming in 1951 in Culver City, California with exterior locations filmed in and around the Los Angeles area and the San Fernando Valley. Episodes follow Superman as he battles gangsters, thugs, mad scientists, meteors and malfunctioning radioactive machines in the city of Metropolis. In the first episode, his origin on the planet Krypton and his arrival on Earth are dramatized while in succeeding episodes, he conceals his identity by posing as mild mannered Daily Planet reporter Clark Kent who, in times of crisis, scoots to a broom closet, sheds his civvies, and reappears in superhero tights and trunks to rescue hapless folk from the clutches of ne'er-do-wells. In the last seasons, the kindly but absent-minded Professor Pepperwinkle creates problems for Superman with his bizarre inventions. </p><p>Adventures of Superman won no major awards but was popular with its audience and remains popular today. Its opening theme, The Superman March, has become a classic of its kind and is instantly recognizable by most television buffs. Since the show's cancellation, several of its stars have participated in Superman-related conventions, autograph signings, and other events. In 2003, Noel Neill published her memoirs Truth, Justice, and The American Way: The Life and Times of Noel Neill. In 2006, the death of George Reeves was dramatized in the film Hollywoodland with Ben Affleck starring in the role of Reeves. In 2006, the series became available in its entirety on DVD and reruns of the show still hold a place on television programming schedules.</p>","updated":1477176117,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1306"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/110876"}}},{"id":1307,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1307/anyone-but-me","name":"Anyone But Me","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama"],"status":"Ended","runtime":15,"premiered":"2008-12-07","schedule":{"time":"","days":[]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":0,"network":null,"webChannel":{"id":2,"name":"Hulu","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"externals":{"tvrage":31118,"thetvdb":108721,"imdb":"tt1385817"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/7/18491.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/7/18491.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Introducing a new generation: gay, straight, and ethnically diverse struggling with identity and modern relationships.</p>","updated":1475685720,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1307"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/110903"}}},{"id":1308,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1308/bad-girls","name":"Bad Girls","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"1999-06-01","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Tuesday"]},"rating":{"average":9},"weight":0,"network":{"id":35,"name":"ITV","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","timezone":"Europe/London"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":2701,"thetvdb":75328,"imdb":"tt0203248"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/7/18492.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/7/18492.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Step inside HMP Larkhall and meet the women of G-Wing, who've committed various offences that range from shoplifting to murder. <strong>Bad Girls</strong> shows what life is like for these women in the 'inside world' and also shows the real-life problems (and maybe behaviour!) of the officers who watch them!</p>","updated":1477286140,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1308"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/111008"}}},{"id":1309,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1309/boomtown","name":"Boomtown","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2002-09-29","schedule":{"time":"","days":[]},"rating":{"average":8},"weight":0,"network":{"id":1,"name":"NBC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":2874,"thetvdb":78619,"imdb":"tt0319960"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/7/18525.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/7/18525.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Each episode of this series, set in present day Los Angeles, examines one crime from many different viewpoints - uniformed cops, detectives, witnesses, the media, the fire department and rescue squad, even the criminals themselves.</p>","updated":1477554014,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1309"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/111034"}}},{"id":1310,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1310/boston-med","name":"Boston Med","type":"Documentary","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Medical"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2010-06-24","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Thursday"]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":0,"network":{"id":3,"name":"ABC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":25622,"thetvdb":171811,"imdb":"tt1673792"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/7/18527.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/7/18527.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Picking up where \"Hopkins\" left off, <strong>Boston Med</strong> travels to a city renowned for medical excellence and home to three superb American hospitals, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Children's Hospital.

She can finally put her high school days as the geeky-girl-with-flop-sweats behind her; she's graduated from medical school and is now a first-year intern at Denver Memorial Hospital, where she'll have the chance to work with world-famous cardiologist Dr. Gina Beckett - and where, not-so-coincidentally, her med-school crush Will Rider is also an intern. So why does everyone keep warning her that the hospital is just like high school? Emily soon finds out the hard way - her high school nemesis, the gorgeous, popular Cassandra Kopelson, is also just starting out at Denver Memorial, and it seems like they're rivals all over again - not only as surgical interns, but for Will's attention. Fellow intern Tyra Granger warns Emily that the cliques at Denver Memorial are all too familiar: the jocks have become orthopedic surgeons; the mean girls are in plastics; the rebels are in the ER, and Tyra has her own awkward place as the principal's kid - her father is the chief resident. Emily's the new kid all over again, and it's just as awkward as high school. Only this time around, Emily will have to balance the personal and emotional turmoil of social politics with the high-stakes world of life-and-death medical decisions. At least she has fellow intern Tyra and nerdy-but-cute resident Micah, to count on as friends. Emily is growing to realize that although she may be a geek, she may also grow to be a great doctor, flop sweats and all.</p>","updated":1476542662,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1317"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/111151"}}},{"id":1318,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1318/exes-ohs","name":"Exes & Ohs","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Romance"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"2007-10-08","schedule":{"time":"19:30","days":["Wednesday"]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":0,"network":{"id":117,"name":"Logo TV","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":17844,"thetvdb":80736,"imdb":"tt0799893"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/7/18562.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/7/18562.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Meet Jennifer, a documentary filmmaker with a vivid fantasy life (which we see) and a floundering career (which we also see).

They are not allowed to leave the house or its' backyard for any reason, they cannot see or read magazines or newspapers, no radios, no computers, no phones, no I pods or MP3 players and only the HOH is given a small portable CD player to listen to CD's left in the HOH room for them.<br /><br />HOH stands for the Head of Household and once every week the guests in the house compete to try and win HOH and all the perks that go along with being the HOH for the week.

While they had primetime news chemistry on-screen, off-screen Chuck was a bit of a self-centered womanizer, and Kelly a bit of an uptight know-it-all. When Chuck grabbed the chance to move up to a larger market, no tears were shed. But after an embarrassing on-air tirade ended up on the Internet, Chuck found himself on the downswing career-wise. He even questioned whether his lifestyle of chasing women and living in hotels was as exciting as it used to be. So when he gets the call to return to Pittsburgh to reunite with Kelly and try to take the newscast back to No. 1, it's an offer he can't refuse. Back in Pittsburgh, Chuck must adapt to a new, chaotic newsroom. In addition to Kelly, he re-teams with familiar faces including Marsh McGinley, the affable, endlessly inappropriate sports anchor, and Gary Crezyzewski the perennially put-upon field reporter who always seems to get left out in the cold; and he has a few new coworkers: Ryan Church the under-qualified, overstressed news director, and Montana Diaz Herrera, the perky, sexy, somewhat inept weather anchor. But perhaps the biggest change is that Kelly is now single mom to 10-year-old Gracie With ego aplenty, Chuck and his former partner Kelly once made primetime news magic, but they wonder if they can make it happen again.</p>","updated":1476588985,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1456"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/654546"}}},{"id":1457,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1457/becker","name":"Becker","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Comedy"],"status":"Ended","runtime":30,"premiered":"1998-11-02","schedule":{"time":"","days":[]},"rating":{"average":7.5},"weight":0,"network":{"id":2,"name":"CBS","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":2748,"thetvdb":77725,"imdb":"tt0174378"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/8/21033.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/8/21033.jpg"},"summary":"<p><strong>Becker</strong> centers on the life of Dr. John Becker, a cantankerous, yet dedicated and talented physician, who, in spite of his constant rants, has a decent heart underneath the sarcasm.

He looks at the world around him and feels society has gone mad - full of inconsistencies and just plain backward thinking. Although he is a diagnostician by trade, Becker feels he can dispense diagnoses even when no one asks.

Keeping mostly to themselves over the millennia and living in remote communities, a small number of cavemen and cavewomen have been slowly migrating from these sub-societies and attempting to acclimate themselves to the Homo sapien world. Needless to say, this has proven difficult. Meet three cavemen who have successfully made the move to San Diego and are just trying to fit in. Joel is a sophisticated and intelligent man who has a beautiful girlfriend, a decent job and shares an apartment with his younger brother, Andy and his best friend, Nick. Nick is wary of the Homo sapien world and feels like he's running away from his heritage. Andy, on the other hand, looks at this new world with his eyes wide open and is willing to take risks in order to learn and live life to the fullest. Nick questions Joel on many of his choices, including his girlfriend, Kate, a beautiful Homo sapien woman. The fact that Kate's eccentric mother, Leslie owns Joel's condominium complex makes things even more complicated for the three roommates. Meanwhile, Kate's best friend, Thorne, is intent on discovering the cavemen's wilder side. On the premiere episode, \"Her Embarrassed of Caveman,\" Joel attempts to hide the fact that he's dating a \"sape\" aka Homo sapien woman from Nick, Andy and friend Maurice, but also feels that she may be embarrassed to tell her friends that she's dating a caveman.

It was created in Canada by Glen Warren Productions and partially funded by Twentieth Century Fox, who now own the broadcast and syndication rights to the series. It was also compiled down into five movies, each composed of two episodes each, with new credit sequences. The series was written by renowned science fiction author Harlan Ellison under a pseudonym of Cordwainer Bird, with additional episodes being written by other sci-fi authors. The plot concerned a giant Noah's Ark-like spaceship, composed of hundreds of huge \"domes\", each containing a sample culture from the planet Earth, which has long since died out due to an unknown disaster. The Ark, damaged from an asteroid collision, goes off course and heads into the path of a distant sun, its crew dead.</p><p>Foreseeing the destruction of the Earth, humanity builds a multi-generational starship called Earthship Ark, 80 kilometres (50 mi) wide and 320 kilometres (200 mi) long. The ship contains dozens of biospheres, each kilometres across and housing people of different cultures; their goal is to find and seed a new world of a distant star. More than one hundred years into the voyage, an unexplained accident occurs, and the ship goes into emergency mode, whereby each biosphere is sealed off from the others.<br />Four hundred and five years after the accident, Devon (Keir Dullea) a resident of Cypress Corners, a conservative agrarian community with a culture resembling that of the Amish, discovers that his world is far larger and more mysterious than he had realized. Considered an outcast because of his questioning of the way things are, especially his refusal to accept the arranged marriage of his love Rachel (Gay Rowan) to his friend Garth (Robin Ward), Devon finds the Cypress Corners elders have been deliberately manipulating the local computer terminal, which they call \"The Voice of The Creator\". The congregation pursues Devon for attacking the elders and stealing a computer cassette on which they have recorded their orders, and its leaders plot to execute him, but the elderly Abraham, who also questions the elders, gives Devon a key to a dark, mysterious doorway, which Abraham himself is afraid to enter. The frightened Devon escapes into the service areas of the ship and accesses a computer data station that explains the nature and purpose of the Ark and hints at its problems.<br />When Devon returns to Cypress Corners to tell his community what he has learned, he is put on trial for heresy and condemned to death by stoning. Escaping on the night before his execution with the aid of Garth, Devon convinces Rachel to come with him, and Garth pursues them. When Rachel refuses to return with Garth, he joins her and Devon. Eventually they make their way to the ship's bridge, containing the skeletal remains of its crew. It is badly damaged and its control systems are inoperative. The three discover that the Ark is on a collision course with a Class G star similar to the Sun, and realize that the only way to save The Ark and its passengers is to find the backup bridge and reactivate the navigation and propulsion systems. Occasionally, they are aided by the ship's partially functioning computer system.</p>","updated":1465618204,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1752"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/152354"}}},{"id":1753,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1753/jonathan-creek","name":"Jonathan Creek","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Crime"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"1997-05-10","schedule":{"time":"21:00","days":["Friday"]},"rating":{"average":8.7},"weight":0,"network":{"id":12,"name":"BBC One","country":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GB","timezone":"Europe/London"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":4073,"thetvdb":75033,"imdb":"tt0118363"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/9/24490.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/9/24490.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Working from his home in a converted windmill, <strong>Jonathan Creek</strong> is a magician with a natural ability for solving puzzles.

But who was Bea Smith before prison? How did a wife and mother from the suburbs become a top dog without rival? Wentworth Prison is a dynamic, often confronting, drama series that begins with Bea's early days in prison. Set in the present day, it is a modern adaptation of Prisoner Cell Block H that contemporises legendary characters and their stories for today's audience. This 10-part series takes the viewer inside to an uncompromising environment that explores the politics of women in a world without men, and how such a threatening experience both challenges and often changes those confined and working behind the razor wire. The audience will be introduced to Bea all over again and meet her allies and enemies in the form of iconic inmates: Doreen Anderson, Liz Birdsworth and Franky Doyle, and there are new faces such as Jacs Holt, the ruthless matriarch of a crime family who now reigns over Wentworth. Favourite offices will also return. Meg Jackson carries a shameful secret; Vera Bennett, the well-meaning officer who discovers everyone has a price; Erica Davidson, the crusading Lawyer and Matthew Fletcher who believes in retribution rather than rehabilitation. And a new face, Meg's husband Will Jackson, whose past still haunts him. Each episode explores an individual character's back story, providing an insight to what makes them tick and the circumstances that led them to Wentworth. In doing so we discover that the difference between an inmate and an officer is sometimes simply geography, because they're all prisoners in surprisingly different ways. Like the original Prisoner Cell Block H, Wentworth Prison is, at its heart, a series about survival, a character drama featuring women living in a pressure cooker environment. Despite the rivalries and power struggles, this family of misfits and rebels are forced to forge unlikely friendships and allegiances if they want to survive their time inside.</p>","updated":1476123608,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1828"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/786179"}}},{"id":1829,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/1829/psychic-matchmaker","name":"Psychic Matchmaker","type":"Reality","language":"English","genres":[],"status":"Running","runtime":30,"premiered":"2015-05-01","schedule":{"time":"22:30","days":[]},"rating":{"average":null},"weight":0,"network":{"id":80,"name":"TLC","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":43681,"thetvdb":295295,"imdb":null},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/12/31451.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/12/31451.jpg"},"summary":"<p>Love is all about finding the perfect connection, and according to psychic Deborah Graham, that connection is a subconscious link that lives inside a person's soul.

The Heathens were on the brink of becoming famous for their kickass live shows and the release of their highly anticipated first album. Until they broke up. The same day the album dropped.

Along the way he's picked up with Simon Ovrannaz (Diego Wallraff), an ex-thief he met in a Turkish prison. The two are best friends...almost brothers.</p><p>Then one day, Largo's life is changed forever when he learns that Nerio Winch (David Carradine), the step-father he barely knew, is dead. Nerio is an Aristotle Onassis-like billionaire who secretly adopted Largo as a child, but never took him in. Instead, he paid a family in Luxembourg to raise him, then sent him to a monastery as a teenager to be educated. Nerio paid the bills, and that was pretty much the extent of their relationship. These last few years, they barely saw each other.</p><p>Now Nerio has committed suicide because he was dying of a brain tumor...and, incredibly, has left his vast fortune and control of Group W, his multi-national corporate empire, to Largo. Largo is overwhelmed by the responsibility of this sudden inheritance. The board of directors at Group W despise him, thinking him unworthy and incompetent.</p><p>Then Largo receives an astonishing video recorded by his step-father just before his death. On it, Nerio reveals that he was once a member of a mysterious organization called <i>The Adriatic Commission</i>, a secret conspiracy of billionaires and politicians who work to control the economic and political destiny of the world for their own ends. For years they have tried to kill Nerio for leaving. In the video Nerio says that if he is dead, despite what the official cause of death may be, it is because they have finally succeeded. Nerio ends by charging Largo with using Group W to seek out and destroy <i>The Commission</i> and uncover the names of its secret members.</p><p>Eventually Largo discovers another bit of amazing information. Nerio was not his step-father at all, but his biological parent. He kept Largo's existence a secret to protect him from <i>The Commission</i>, which would have surely used the son against the father.</p><p>And so Largo faces a series of enormous challenges. He must learn to run one of the world's biggest corporations, all the while being opposed and undermined at every turn by his own Board of Directors. They are led by Michel Cardignac (Charles Powell), a charming, scheming, ruthless executive who will do whatever he can to see Largo ousted and himself at the head of Group W.</p><p>Largo must also follow his father's wishes and try to expose and destroy <i>The Adriatic Commission</i>. And since <i>The Commission</i> is determined to gain control of Group W, they are always shadowing him, always waiting for an opportunity to pounce and destroy him.</p><p>But Largo is an adventurer at heart, not a businessman. And so, at every opportunity, he bolts the boardroom and sets off in search of excitement. But he doesn't go alone.

But why should he - he's rich! The son of an oil tycoon, Steve hasn't had to work a day in his life and has always gotten everything he's wanted - with one exception: the love of Emmy. The daughter of a former Wilde housekeeper, Emmy is an earnest do-gooder who has spent her adult life trying to save the world. And though Emmy is content living with an indigenous tribe in the Amazon rainforest, her 12-year-old daughter, PUDDLE (Stefania Owen), just wants to be a normal kid experiencing her adolescence in a normal place. And she would speak up except for the fact that she hasn't spoken in years. When Wilde Oil's expansion in the rainforest threatens her adopted tribe, Emmy decides to attend Steve's self-thrown \"Humanitarian of the Year\" award ceremony in hopes of convincing him to help her cause...and also maybe because she still has a thing for Steve. But same-old Steve is unwilling to help because fighting Wilde Oil (a/k/a Dad) means putting his meal ticket in jeopardy. Rather than run the risk of letting Emmy slip away again, Steve pulls out all the stops to win her heart. To do so, he enlists the only other people in his life who can help: MIGO SALAZAR (Joe Nunez), Steve's employee/sidekick/errand-boy, and GERTIE STELLVERTRETTER (Jayne Houdyshell), Steve's nanny-turned-head-of-security as well as the biggest protector of Steve...and her own job. Despite having everything he ever wanted, Steve knows he can't buy love and happiness, which falls in sharp contrast to Emmy, who has nothing but love and happiness. So with Emmy committed to doing good for nothing, and Steve being a good for nothing, will this hopelessly mismatched pair ever be able to reconcile their differences?</p>","updated":1470948621,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/2007"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/161650"}}},{"id":2008,"url":"http://www.tvmaze.com/shows/2008/skins","name":"Skins","type":"Scripted","language":"English","genres":["Drama","Romance"],"status":"Ended","runtime":60,"premiered":"2011-01-17","schedule":{"time":"22:00","days":["Monday"]},"rating":{"average":5.3},"weight":0,"network":{"id":22,"name":"MTV","country":{"name":"United States","code":"US","timezone":"America/New_York"}},"webChannel":null,"externals":{"tvrage":25843,"thetvdb":174991,"imdb":"tt1755893"},"image":{"medium":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/medium_portrait/11/28126.jpg","original":"http://tvmazecdn.com/uploads/images/original_untouched/11/28126.jpg"},"summary":"<p><strong>Skins</strong> is about the lives and loves of teenagers and the obligations of friendship.

EDT, the show was successful enough for it to continue throughout the 1965-66 TV season, with a change in time period to 4:30 P.M. Eastern time following the horror soap opera <i>Dark Shadows</i>. Both programs attracted a young audience who watch the shows after school.</p><p>The show's theme song, \"Action\", became a hit single for Freddy \"Boom Boom\" Cannon, peaking on the charts (#13) in September 1965. Most of the telecasts, all of which were produced in black-and-white, were taped at various locales inSouthern California although a handful of segments were taped elsewhere in the country. The theme song was written by Steve Venet and Tommy Boyce. Later Boyce co-wrote songs for The Monkees.</p><p>The program had its own stable of performers, most notably Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, who served as the <i>de facto</i>house band.

This untraditional arrangement can be tricky at times, but they always stick it out, because somewhere underneath all the muck they love each other... plus, they have no choice. Kim and Louie's best friends are Mike and Tina, a married couple with an enviably simple life (Mike brings home the bacon, Tina in turn has sex with him) and a bunch of kids from their current and previous marriages. Across the hall are an African-American couple, Walter and Ellen, and their daughter Lisa, a family with whom Louie awkwardly tries to cultivate a friendship. Also living in the building is Kim's eccentric brother Jerry, who has a blurry past and is in constant need of direction (and food). There's also Louie's friend Rich, who lives with his mother and earns a living through shady means.
