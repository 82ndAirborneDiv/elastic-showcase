Mosquitoes become infected with the virus when they feed on infected birds. \nIn a very small number of cases WNV has been spread: \n* through blood transfusions \n* through organ transplants \n* from mother to fetus and \n* possibly through breastfeeding in 1 documented case. \nScreening of the entire U.S. blood supply for the presence of WNV now makes transmission from a blood transfusion very unlikely. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should discuss WNV with their doctor if they are concerned.
